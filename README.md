# Fresh-SPA project

demo: [https://frsh-spa.deno.dev](https://frsh-spa.deno.dev)

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

## The problem is that completion changes the contents of fresh.gen.ts. In this case, fix it like this example.

```tsx
import * as $0 from "./routes/_404.tsx";
import * as $1 from "./routes/_app.tsx";
import * as $2 from "./routes/api/joke.ts";
import * as $3 from "./routes/greet/[name].tsx";
import * as $4 from "./routes/index.tsx";
import * as $$0 from "./islands/Counter.tsx";

// --- fix line ---
import * as FsRouter from "./fresh-spa/routing/router.tsx";
import * as FsShow from "./fresh-spa/routing/show.tsx";
import * as FsLink from "./fresh-spa/routing/SPALink.tsx";
// --- fix line ---

const manifest = {
  routes: {
    "./routes/_404.tsx": $0,
    "./routes/_app.tsx": $1,
    "./routes/api/joke.ts": $2,
    "./routes/greet/[name].tsx": $3,
    "./routes/index.tsx": $4,
  },
  islands: {
    "./islands/Counter.tsx": $$0,
    // --- fix line --
    "./fresh-spa/routing/router.tsx": FsRouter,
    "./fresh-spa/routing/show.tsx": FsShow,
    "./fresh-spa/routing/SPALink.tsx": FsLink,
    // --- fix line --
  },
  baseUrl: import.meta.url,
};

export default manifest;
```
